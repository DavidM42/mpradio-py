# mpradio-py

Work in progress.

The old implementation deeply relies on external services and it's not very object oriented nor flexible to changes, resulting in it being inconsistent in the user expirience across multiple devices and configurations. This project aims for a total rewrite with some structural changes to make it more modular, and try to integrate dependencies as much as possible for a better management.
